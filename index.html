        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p id="textwrap">
            Welcome to my webpage! My name is Owen Bench, and I'm currently a student
            at Davis Technical College in Utah, as well as a high school student at
            Northern Utah Academy for Math, Enginnering & Science (NUAMES). This page
            was made to hold my e-portfolio and as a project for a Davis Tech course.
            I will regularly update this page both as my portfolio expands and as my
            course requires edits to the page.
            This webpage has two main purposes which you know already: To house my
            portfolio and get comissions from. Commissions for what you might ask?
            Here's what I do comissions for:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Writings</dt>
                <dd>
                    Depending on the content, I can either help with the writing
                    process or write content for you. I <em>will not</em> take commissions
                    for writing papers or essays for schooling, I will only give
                    pointers and advice for these types of writing.
                </dd>
            <dt>Programming</dt>
                <dd>
                    I will write programs or build webpages for you. The cost of
                    a commission will depend on the length and complexity of the
                    program. If you want a simple Auto Hotkey program to be made,
                    say to automatically write files into an Excel sheet, that would
                    be the cheaper end. On the higher end would be things like small
                    games or large webpages.
                </dd>
            <dt>Covers</dt>
                <dd>
                    I currently play drums as a hobby, and will do commissions for
                    covers of songs. Plain and simple. Cost will again depend on
                    length and complexity and I will negotiate what I feel would be
                    a fair price for the cover.
                </dd>
        </dl>
        If you're interested in doing a commission, go to the <a href="commissions.html">commissions page</a>
        for further information. Taking <em>any</em> content that was commissioned and claiming it as your
        own is plagiarism, so please either ask permission before posting commissions or give credit in the posts.
