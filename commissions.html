            <p>This is my commissions hub! You can find all the information you need here.</p>

                    <h3>Writings</h3>
                    <p>
                        Writing can be anything from spell/grammar checking, tutoring,
                        and writing of anything you might want. This <b>does not</b>
                        include academic papers or anything intended to be used and passed
                        off as your own work. Any writing commission sent is made with that
                        in mind, and that reuse of my work unless given word will be
                        considered plagiarism.

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                        Programming can be any tutoring, aid, second opinion, or creation
                        you might want. This <b>does not</b> include anything meant to
                        pass of as one's own work, like academic or professional work.
                        Give credit where it's due if you want to reuse it. Price will
                        vary depending on program length and complexity.

                    <h3>Covers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Covers can be any piece of music that I can play drums to. 
                        Whether it be trying to faithfully recreate a part or creating
                        parts for your song. Price will vary depending on song length
                        and complexity, which I will negotiate.
